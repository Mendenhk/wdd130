  <h1>Week1 Code-along Activity - Favorite City</h1>
  <p>
    I have two favorite cities, Paris and my home town, Cedar City, UT <br>
    I will talk about Paris. Beautiful city with lovely people. I have been<br>
    many times as I at one time in my life dated a french girl in France. Love the<br>
    architecture, the history, and the food, especially the desserts.
